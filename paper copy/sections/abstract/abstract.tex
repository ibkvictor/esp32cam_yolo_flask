        Security of lives and property is of paramount concern to individuals around the globe. Smart security systems are used by individual and corporate organization to ensure protection of . However,  and constant surviellance is necessary to deter vandalism or buglery during non-working hours. of  similar to the  Morh's law. Thus, mordern surveillance systems are becoming prominent choices for montoriing access to activities and access to property. This increaes is as a result of the conversely decreasing in cost of computation processign power with processing capacity in a derivative of the Mohr's law. Futhermore, technological advances have been made on sensors and electronic devices to make sub video-recording accessible to majority of the population with little technical knowledge required. In this project, we design and implemeent a smart surveillance system that records using the OVA - camera sensors and broadcasts it over a network such that it is retreivable from any location provided wireless network access is available. Also, we develop a alarm system to notify with emails in the event of an intrusion.
