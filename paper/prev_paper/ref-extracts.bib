	abstract = {MMCs are prepared by dispersing a reinforcing material into a metal matrix. Composites are prepared by stir casting, powder metallurgy, squeeze casting, spray deposition etc. MMC offer improved mechanical and tribological properties over conventional metals and currently are considered as potential material for light weight application. Due to high strength to weight ratio, high tensile strength, toughness, high wear resistance, these materials are used in automobile, aerospace, sports, and many more fields. Irrespective of these advantages there are some technological barriers in development of composites. Some of them are obtaining uniform distribution of reinforcement among matrix, high processing cost with methods other than casting, availability of low cost reinforcement and machining of composites after preparation if required. Currently SiC, TiB2, Al2O3, B4C are used as reinforcement with Al alloys. Some research carried out on hybrid composite with fly ash, lignite ash, coconut husk has also given better results than single reinforcement. This paper reviews current development in Aluminum matrix composite preparation, processing methods, mechanical properties and some challenges in development of composites.}

Replacing SiC gradually by diamond particles results in a steady increase of thermal conductivity from 220 to 580Wm−1K−1. Electrical conductivity measurements indicate that the silicon content in the matrix decreases with increasing diamond volume fraction. Predictions of the differential effective medium scheme generalized for multiple types of inclusions agree well with experimental results.}

	journal = {Materials Research Express},
	abstract = {This paper explores the microstructural, mechanical and the tribological behaviour of rice husk ash (RHA, 5, 10 and 15 wt%) reinforced aluminium based composites fabricated using the powder metallurgy (PM) route. The main advantage of this composite is utilization of RHA (an agricultural waste), with its improved mechanical and wear properties. Powder mixtures are cold pressed uni-axially and later the green compacts are sintered under argon gas atmosphere in electric furnace. For the investigation of microstructural features, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis has been performed. Tribological behaviour was evaluated on pin-on-disc wear tester machine using Taguchi and ANOVA techniques. Addition of RHA increased the composite’s hardness by 20%–25% and wear behaviour got improved by 15%–40%. Based on the micrographic images of worn out surfaces and wear debris, wear mechanism is also discussed. In addition to this, artificial neural network model is also proposed and wear behaviour of the composite is also predicted. By comparing the experimental results with predicted results, it can be said that a well-trained ANN model is an efficient tool for predicting tribological behaviour.}

@article{Wang2021,
	abstract = {In recent years, the severe energy consumption identified in the global power-transmission process makes the development of new generation of transmission materials with high strength (mainly the ultimate tensile strength) and outstanding electrical conductivity (EC) more urgent. Though Al and its alloys received significant attention from the scientific community in the past two decades due to their relatively high mechanical properties and excellent EC, increasing strength and EC are often incompatible in Al conductor alloys, which remains unresolved. Therefore, the ways to achieve the optimal compromise between the strength and EC has become a hot topic in current researches. This review focuses on the high-strength conductive Al alloys that have been studied by researchers in the past two decades, and endeavors to reveal the relationship between the EC and the strength based on composition, microstructure, interface, and others. Moreover, the design ideas and treatment measures considering both conductivity and strength are also summarized.},

@article{Inegbenebor2018,
abstract = {In this paper, conventional simple methods of producing MMC with attained properties through the dispersion of silicon carbide in the matrix are investigated. To achieve these objectives a two-step mixing method of stir casting technique was employed. Aluminum (99.66 {\%}C.P) and SiC (320 and 1200 grits) were chosen as matrix and reinforcement materials respectively. Experiments were conducted by varying the weight fraction of SiC for 2.5 {\%}, 5.0 {\%}, 7.5 {\%} and 10 {\%}. The result indicated that the stir casting method was quite successful to obtain uniform dispersion of reinforcement in the matrix. This was evident by the improvement of properties of composites over the base metal. Reinforced Aluminum Silicon Carbide (ASC) showed an increase in Young's modulus (E) and hardness above the unreinforced case and marginal reduction of electrical conductivity was recorded for the composites. The silicon carbide of 1200 grits (3 $\mu$m) showed increased Young's modulus (E) and hardness of 1517.6 Mpa and 26.1 Hv values at 7.5{\%} volume fraction silicon carbide; when compared with the silicon carbide 320 grit (29 $\mu$m). Also; the electrical conductivity properties of the two grit sizes of the silicon carbides were less than the base metal for all the volume fractions of silicon carbide.},
